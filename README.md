# Basilisk

Basilisk is a work in progress third-party [Discord](https://discord.com/)
client for Macs.

Goals:

- Be a good macOS app. Follow the
  [macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/).
- Present as a first-party client to Discord's servers. Spam, automation, and
  abuse are not goals of Basilisk, but extra steps are taken to avoid account
  bans.
- Consume less CPU, memory, and energy than Discord's official client.

## Requirements

Swift 5.7 (Xcode 14.0) or later is required to build.
