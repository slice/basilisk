# basilisk

Basilisk is a work in progress third-party client for
[Discord](https://discord.com/) for macOS.

Goals:

- Be a good macOS citizen. Follow the
  [macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/).
- Present as a first-party client to Discord's servers. Spam, automation, and
  abuse are not goals of Basilisk. However, having your account banned due to
  anti-spam heuristics is not a goal either.
- Consume less CPU and memory than Discord's official client.
